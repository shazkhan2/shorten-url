Lessons learned:
1. Postman does not enforce Cors; Cors errors happen in browsers on the client side.
2. Not all APIs are freely available. In case there are origin access controls, the workaround is to create a server that you can call, which in return will call the API.
3. React and Node are constantly evolving so any unusual errors would require a good understanding and an optimal solution.
4. There is a copy to clipboard library available in React.
