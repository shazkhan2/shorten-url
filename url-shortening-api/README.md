<h1>Features></h1>
1. <h2>Mitigation of CORS Restrictions:</h2> Utilizes a custom backend server and API to circumvent CORS restrictions imposed by the third-party API. 
2. <h2>URL Shortening Functionality:</h2> The web application sends requests to the API server, which then communicates with the public API to shorten URLs, implemented using node-fetch. 
3. <h2>ES6 Modules Support: </h2> Overcame compatibility issues with older NPM packages reliant on CommonJS by introducing support for ES6 modules. Notably, files are designated with the .mjs extension to signal the adoption of ES module syntax.
4. <h2>Responsive UI Design: </h2> Dynamically adjusts UI components based on screen size, featuring a toggleable navigation bar.

<h1>Lessons Learned </h1>
1. <h2>CORS Challenges: </h2> CORS errors predominantly manifest in browser environments, highlighting the necessity for server-side mitigation strategies.
2. <h2>Access Control Workarounds: </h2>  Overcoming origin access controls need intermediary servers/ proxies to access restricted APIs.
3. <h2>Adaptability in Development: </h2> Due to the evolving nature of React and Node ecosystems, it is important to improve my troubleshooting skills and to find innovative olutions for unforeseen errors.
4. <h2>Clipboard Functionality: </h2> Discovered that React library has a builtin clipboard functionality.
